program factorial

// idea: initialize a variable with a value in the procedure signature as the output
// e.g. proc fact: int n -> x = 1 {...
// then, the following could be the return point of the function:
// return
// }
// also this is the syntax for single-line comments

proc fact: int n -> int {
    x = 1
    for i = n i > 0 i-- {
        x *= i       
    }   
    return x
}
